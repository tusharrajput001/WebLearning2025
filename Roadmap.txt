✅ fetch API, Promises, async/await




⚛️ Phase 2: React Fundamentals (7 Days)
Goal: React ka flow samajhna + components banana
✅ Setting up React (Vite recommended)
✅ JSX syntax
✅ Functional Components
✅ props (data pass from parent to child)
✅ useState for state management
✅ Event handling (onClick, onChange)
✅ map() for rendering lists
✅ Conditional rendering (if, ternary, &&)
✅ Component reuse & folder structure

🧪 Practice Mini Projects:
 Counter App
 Greeting component (props)
 Dynamic List display (array of names/tasks)







🧰 Phase 3: Intermediate React (7–10 Days)
Goal: React applications build karna with confidence
✅ useEffect (run on mount / update)
✅ Forms in React (controlled components)
✅ Lifting state up
✅ Component communication (parent-child)
✅ Basic project folder structure
✅ Conditional UI (based on API response/state)

🧪 Projects:
 Weather App (OpenWeather API)
 Todo App (add/delete/mark)
 GitHub User Finder (with loading & error state)






📂 Phase 4: Advanced React Concepts (10–15 Days)
Goal: Real-world app features banana
✅ useContext for global state
✅ useReducer (for advanced state logic)
✅ Custom Hooks
✅ React Router v6 (Pages, navigation)
✅ Form validation with libraries (like yup, formik)
✅ API handling + loading/error UI
✅ Handling side effects
🧪 Project:
 Blog App (Add, Edit, Delete post)
 Auth-based Login App (mock token)
 Notes App (with search/filter)





⚙️ Phase 5: Next.js & Integration (10–15 Days)
Goal: SSR + Folder-based routing + Backend connect
✅ Pages vs Components
✅ Dynamic routing
✅ API routes
✅ SSR vs CSR
✅ Static Generation (SSG)
✅ Connect with Spring Boot / Mendix backend
🧪 Project:
 Portfolio site (with getStaticProps)
 Blog with Next.js + Markdown
 Task Tracker App (CRUD + API)



📤 Phase 6: Git, Deployment & Dev Practice
Goal: Real developer mindset + GitHub-ready profile
✅ Git basics: init, add, commit, push, pull
✅ GitHub repo setup for all projects
✅ Deployment: Vercel (Next.js), Netlify (React), Surge.sh
✅ README writing (Project desc + setup)
🚀 Bonus Phase: Add-ons for Extra Edge
✅ TypeScript basics (optional but valuable)
✅ TailwindCSS or styled-components for UI
✅ Start DSA daily (LeetCode 1 Q/day)
✅ React + Spring Boot Integration (next step after React confident)
