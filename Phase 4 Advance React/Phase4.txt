ðŸ“‚ Phase 4: Advanced React Concepts (10â€“15 Days)
Goal: Real-world app features banana
âœ… useContext for global state
âœ… useReducer (for advanced state logic)
âœ… Custom Hooks
âœ… React Router v6 (Pages, navigation)
âœ… Form validation with libraries (like yup, formik)
âœ… API handling + loading/error UI
âœ… Handling side effects
ðŸ§ª Project:
 Blog App (Add, Edit, Delete post)
 Auth-based Login App (mock token)
 Notes App (with search/filter)



 ðŸ“† Day 1: Introduction to useContext
âœ… Learn what Context API is and when to use it.
âœ… Implement a basic global state using useContext.
ðŸ›  Practice: Theme toggle or User Authentication Context.


ðŸ“† Day 2: useReducer for Advanced State Logic
âœ… Understand useReducer vs useState.
âœ… Implement useReducer in a counter or todo app.
ðŸ§© Combine useReducer with useContext for global state management.


ðŸ“† Day 3: Custom Hooks
âœ… Learn how to extract logic into reusable custom hooks.
âœ… Create hooks like useToggle, useForm, useFetch.
ðŸ›  Refactor previous apps (like counter or todo) to use custom hooks.

ðŸ“† Day 4: React Router v6 - Basics
âœ… Install react-router-dom.
âœ… Set up routes using BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route.
âœ… Add navigation with Link and useNavigate.


ðŸ“† Day 5: React Router v6 - Advanced
âœ… Learn about route params (useParams), nested routes, and dynamic routing.
âœ… Add private routes and redirects using mock authentication.

ðŸ“† Day 6: Form Validation Libraries
âœ… Install and use Formik for form handling.
âœ… Add validation with Yup schema.
ðŸ§ª Practice with login/register forms.

ðŸ“† Day 7: API Handling - Fetching Data
âœ… Use fetch or axios for GET/POST.
âœ… Display loading and error UI states.
âœ… Use useEffect for API side effects.


ðŸ“† Day 8: Advanced API Handling
âœ… Handle CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
âœ… Modularize API logic with custom hooks (like useApi).
âœ… Add global error/toast notifications.


ðŸ“† Day 9: Side Effects
âœ… Master useEffect for component lifecycle simulation.
âœ… Learn about cleanup functions.
âœ… Practice polling, debouncing, and conditional effects.


ðŸ“† Day 10â€“12: Project â€“ Blog App
ðŸ“Œ Features: Add, Edit, Delete posts.
âœ… Use Context for user/auth.
âœ… React Router for pages (Home, Post, Edit).
âœ… Formik + Yup for post forms.
âœ… API or localStorage to save data.

ðŸ“† Day 13â€“14: Project â€“ Auth-based Login App
âœ… Mock login with token-based auth.
âœ… Private/public routes.
âœ… Store token in context or localStorage.
âœ… Redirect on login/logout.
âœ… Basic validation with Formik/Yup.

ðŸ“† Day 15: Project â€“ Notes App
âœ… Features: Add, Delete, Search, Filter notes.
âœ… Custom hooks for logic (e.g. useNotes).
âœ… Persist notes with localStorage or backend.
âœ… Bonus: Dark/light mode with useContext.
