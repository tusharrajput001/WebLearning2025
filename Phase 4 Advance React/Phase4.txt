📂 Phase 4: Advanced React Concepts (10–15 Days)
Goal: Real-world app features banana
✅ useContext for global state
✅ useReducer (for advanced state logic)
✅ Custom Hooks
✅ React Router v6 (Pages, navigation)
✅ Form validation with libraries (like yup, formik)
✅ API handling + loading/error UI
✅ Handling side effects
🧪 Project:
 Blog App (Add, Edit, Delete post)
 Auth-based Login App (mock token)
 Notes App (with search/filter)



 📆 Day 1: Introduction to useContext
Learn what Context API is and when to use it. ✅
Implement a basic global state using useContext. ✅
🛠 Practice: Theme toggle and User Authentication Context. ✅


📆 Day 2: useReducer for Advanced State Logic 
Understand useReducer vs useState. ✅
Implement useReducer in a counter and todo app. ✅
🧩 Combine useReducer with useContext for global state management.  ✅


📆 Day 3: Custom Hooks and Router
Learn how to extract logic into reusable custom hooks. ✅
Create hooks like useToggle, useForm, useFetch. ✅
Install react-router-dom.  ✅
Set up routes using BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route.  ✅
Add navigation with Link and useNavigate. ✅


📆 Day 4: Form Validation Libraries
Install and use Formik for form handling.
Add validation with Yup schema.
🧪 Practice with login/register forms.

📆 Day 5: API Handling - Fetching Data
Use fetch or axios for GET/POST.
Display loading and error UI states.
Use useEffect for API side effects.


📆 Day 6: Advanced API Handling
Handle CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Modularize API logic with custom hooks (like useApi).
Add global error/toast notifications.


📆 Day 7: Side Effects
Master useEffect for component lifecycle simulation.
Learn about cleanup functions.
Practice polling, debouncing, and conditional effects.


📆 Day 8–10: Project – Blog App
📌 Features: Add, Edit, Delete posts.
Use Context for user/auth.
React Router for pages (Home, Post, Edit).
Formik + Yup for post forms.
API or localStorage to save data.

📆 Day 11–13: Project – Auth-based Login App
Mock login with token-based auth.
Private/public routes.
Store token in context or localStorage.
Redirect on login/logout.
Basic validation with Formik/Yup.

📆 Day 14: Project – Notes App
Features: Add, Delete, Search, Filter notes.
Custom hooks for logic (e.g. useNotes).
Persist notes with localStorage or backend.
Bonus: Dark/light mode with useContext.
