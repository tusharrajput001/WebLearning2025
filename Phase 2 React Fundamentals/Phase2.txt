⚛️ Phase 2: React Fundamentals (6 Days)
Goal: React ka flow samajhna + components banana
✅ Setting up React (Vite recommended)
✅ JSX syntax
✅ Functional Components
✅ props (data pass from parent to child)
✅ useState for state management
✅ Event handling (onClick, onChange)
✅ map() for rendering lists
✅ Conditional rendering (if, ternary, &&)
✅ Component reuse & folder structure

🧪 Practice Mini Projects:
 Counter App
 Greeting component (props)
 Dynamic List display (array of names/tasks)



🗓️ Day 1: Functional Components & Props 

Goal: Build reusable components and pass data via props. 
Topics:
Functional components syntax ✅
Props: passing data from parent to child ✅
Props destructuring ✅
Tasks:
Create a Greeting component that takes name and message as props ✅
Practice Mini Project: ✅
🧪 Greeting Card Generator
Example: <Greeting name="Amit" message="Welcome to React!" /> ✅



🗓️ Day 2: useState & Handling Events

Goal: Learn how to add interactivity using state and events.
Topics:
useState hook for managing local state✅ 
Event handlers: onClick, onChange✅
Updating state immutably✅
Tasks:
Build a simple Counter component✅
Add increment and decrement buttons✅
Practice Mini Project:✅

🧪 Counter App
(Bonus: Add a Reset button and disable decrement at 0)✅


🗓️ Day 3: Rendering Lists with map()

Goal: Dynamically render arrays using map(). ✅
Topics:
Rendering arrays of data ✅
Assigning key props ✅
Displaying list items via child components ✅
Tasks:
Create an array of tasks or names and render it using .map() ✅
Practice Mini Project:
🧪 To-Do List (Just display tasks for now, no state updates yet) ✅



🗓️ Day 4: Conditional Rendering
Goal: Show or hide parts of the UI based on conditions.
Topics:
if, ternary ? :, and && for rendering
Using conditions with props or state
Tasks:
Create a component that displays "Good Morning" or "Good Night" based on a Boolean isMorning state
Practice Mini Project:
🧪 Login/Logout Toggle UI
(Show either a login or logout button and welcome message based on logged-in state)



🗓️ Day5: Component Reuse & Folder Structure
Goal: Learn to structure your app and reuse components.
Topics:
Best practices for folder structure
Organizing components in /components
Reusable button, card, list item components
Tasks:
Refactor previous mini projects into separate components
Create a Button component that accepts text and onClick as props




🗓️ Day 6: Recap + Final Mini Project
Goal: Revise everything and apply it in a single project.
Mini Project Idea:
🧪 Task Manager (Basic Version)
Input field to add task (use useState)
Display tasks using .map()
Conditionally render “No Tasks” if list is empty
Reuse TaskItem component
Also:
Do a code walkthrough of what you've built so far
Reflect on what you understand vs what feels confusing
Would you like me to make this plan into a downloadable PDF or Notion-compatible format?
