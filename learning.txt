🧠 React Mastery Roadmap (From Zero to Pro)

🧾 Phase 1: JavaScript Refresher (2–3 Days)
Goal: React use karne ke liye JS pe solid grip
✅ Variables, functions, objects, arrays
✅ ES6: let/const, arrow functions, template literals
✅ Array methods: map, filter, find, reduce
✅ DOM basics (not deeply needed in React)
✅ fetch API, Promises, async/await


⚡ 3-Day JavaScript Refresher Plan (Only What's Needed for React)

✅ Day 1 – JS Core + ES6
🧠 Goal: Syntax + functions + arrays + objects + ES6
Learn:
let, const, var – scope difference
Arrow functions ()=>{}
Template literals `Hello ${name}`
Object & array destructuring
Spread/rest operator ...
Array methods: map, filter, find, reduce

Practice (20–30 mins):
 Create array of numbers → filter even numbers
 Map over array of users → return names
 Use object destructuring in a function
 Merge two arrays/objects using spread






✅ Day 2 – Functions, Async, Promises
🧠 Goal: Logic + async flow samajhna (React + API ke liye must)

Learn:
Callback vs Promise vs async/await

fetch() API calls

setTimeout, setInterval

Arrow vs normal function behavior with this

Practice:
 Create fake fetch API using setTimeout

 Write a function using async/await

 Chain 2 Promises and handle errors

 Timer using setInterval (auto stop after 10 secs)

✅ Day 3 – DOM + LocalStorage + Real Practice
🧠 Goal: DOM events, simple UI control + local storage use

Learn:
document.querySelector(), addEventListener()

localStorage.setItem(), getItem()

JSON.stringify / parse

Form input handling

Mini Project:
 Counter App (Button + / -)

 Form that saves name in localStorage

 Dark/Light Mode toggle using button

🔁 Optional: One 30-minute LeetCode Session (DSA touch)
Just solve 1-2 array or string problems (Easy level)





⚛️ Phase 2: React Fundamentals (7 Days)
Goal: React ka flow samajhna + components banana

✅ Setting up React (Vite recommended)

✅ JSX syntax

✅ Functional Components

✅ props (data pass from parent to child)

✅ useState for state management

✅ Event handling (onClick, onChange)

✅ map() for rendering lists

✅ Conditional rendering (if, ternary, &&)

✅ Component reuse & folder structure

🧪 Practice Mini Projects:

 Counter App

 Greeting component (props)

 Dynamic List display (array of names/tasks)

🧰 Phase 3: Intermediate React (7–10 Days)
Goal: React applications build karna with confidence

✅ useEffect (run on mount / update)

✅ Forms in React (controlled components)

✅ Lifting state up

✅ Component communication (parent-child)

✅ Basic project folder structure

✅ Conditional UI (based on API response/state)

🧪 Projects:

 Weather App (OpenWeather API)

 Todo App (add/delete/mark)

 GitHub User Finder (with loading & error state)

📂 Phase 4: Advanced React Concepts (10–15 Days)
Goal: Real-world app features banana

✅ useContext for global state

✅ useReducer (for advanced state logic)

✅ Custom Hooks

✅ React Router v6 (Pages, navigation)

✅ Form validation with libraries (like yup, formik)

✅ API handling + loading/error UI

✅ Handling side effects

🧪 Project:

 Blog App (Add, Edit, Delete post)

 Auth-based Login App (mock token)

 Notes App (with search/filter)

⚙️ Phase 5: Next.js & Integration (10–15 Days)
Goal: SSR + Folder-based routing + Backend connect

✅ Pages vs Components

✅ Dynamic routing

✅ API routes

✅ SSR vs CSR

✅ Static Generation (SSG)

✅ Connect with Spring Boot / Mendix backend

🧪 Project:

 Portfolio site (with getStaticProps)

 Blog with Next.js + Markdown

 Task Tracker App (CRUD + API)

📤 Phase 6: Git, Deployment & Dev Practice
Goal: Real developer mindset + GitHub-ready profile

✅ Git basics: init, add, commit, push, pull

✅ GitHub repo setup for all projects

✅ Deployment: Vercel (Next.js), Netlify (React), Surge.sh

✅ README writing (Project desc + setup)

🚀 Bonus Phase: Add-ons for Extra Edge
✅ TypeScript basics (optional but valuable)

✅ TailwindCSS or styled-components for UI

✅ Start DSA daily (LeetCode 1 Q/day)

✅ React + Spring Boot Integration (next step after React confident)
